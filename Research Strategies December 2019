First, CTRL+Click on the class I'm having trouble understanding, then look for a method or property relevant to what I'm trying to accomplish.
If this fails, look in the Unity documentation about the class.
If still unsure how to proceed, Google relevant problem and see how others solved it on StackOverflow.
If unable to find anything relevant to the problem I'm trying to solve, work on a different problem and start this process over again another day.

Compared to at the beginning of the semester, where I was mostly just Googling and copying and pasting code and tweaking parameters to try and understand things, my learning process has improved by miles.
I'm not sure how to improve this process further and would love some direction.
