Take random working code,
tweak random parameters,
try to figure out what they do,
borrow the logic of the functions they use to create new functions using parallel logic,
look up the proper syntax for what you're trying to accomplish in the Microsoft Docs or Unity Forums,
hope that it works?
If it doesn't, repeat ad infinitum.
